The following screenshot shows the output of the basic Node.js HTTP server created using the built-in http module. When the server is accessed through http://localhost:3000
, it sends an HTML response displaying the message:

üí¨ ‚ÄúHello REST API‚Äù

The server responds with status code 200 and content type text/html. The response contains simple HTML styled with a white background and bold black text.

This output verifies that:

The Node.js server is running successfully.

The browser receives and renders the HTML content correctly.

The server is accessible via the specified port (3000) on localhost.
